Function name: clear()
Worst case runtime: O(N)
Analysis: I used a vector as the underlying structure for the stack in my program, therefore my clear function simply
	calls the vector clear function to remove all the elements in the stack. The standard vector clear function runs
	in O(N) time because it runs through each element in the vector and deletes them one by one. Because this function
	is made to delete every element in the vector, it will always run in O(N) time, where N represents the number of
	elements stored in the vector.
